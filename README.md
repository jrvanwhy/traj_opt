traj_opt
========

Currently under-construction tool for nonlinear programming and trajectory optimization in MATLAB. I intend to develop this for a while,
then port it to a more open platform (Julia and/or Rust).

Feel free to contact me if you wish for help using this library or have a feature request/bug report, my email should be visible
on my GitHub profile.

Requires the symbolic and optimization toolboxes.
