This is a trajectory optimization framework written in MATLAB intended for
robotics-related usage. It supports optimization of dynamic systems, including
optimization through phase sequences for hybrid dynamic systems. Additionally,
it contains tools for the optimization of phase sequences for hybrid dynamic
systems.

The main documentation may be found in the "doc" directory.
